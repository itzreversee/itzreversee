haii, it iz me - reesa~! âœ¨
===========================
I love tinkering with silly stuff!

### (I HAVE A WEBSITE NOW!!1!)](https://reesa.nekoweb.org/)

## ðŸŒŸQuick info about me
- I love games and game development (mainly Godot) (GDScript, C#)
- My new obsession -> Rust!
- Ocasionally doing mobile apps (Flutter) and web projects (JS, React)
- Data and tinkering (Python, Bash)
- Other stuff I know (C, C++, Java)
- I try to code since I was 10, or even earlier, I can't recall tho. :/

## ðŸ”§Tech I use
- Linux is my passion (Arch + Plasma)
- I use VS Code to edit everything, ocasionally the chunky Visual Studio or JetBrains IDEs.
- Zen Browser instead of Firefox, it feels much more at home and overally faster and smoother. Needs twearking some settings but whatever.
