Hi there, it's me, reversee! 
===========================
 
I am a young **"developer"** from Poland,  
I enjoy writing code in IDEs, and failing immeasurably, and crying in a corner...   
I like `Typescript` `Python` `.NET stuff` 

## facts, that are true, really
Best color is dark purple ( like that i have in stats )  
Best IDE is Intellij Idea ( webstorm ).  
Assembly and C++ are the worst

Best Windows is 11  
Best Linux is Arch
