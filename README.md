Hi there, it's me, reversee! 
===========================
 
I am a young **"developer"** from Poland,  
I enjoy writing code in IDEs, and failing immeasurably, and crying in a corner...   
Well, umm I like `Typescript` `Python` `.NET stuff` 

## facts, that are true, really
Best IDE is Intellij Idea ( webstorm ).
Assembly and C++ are the worst
