Hi there, it's me, reversee!

I am a young **"developer"** from Poland,  
I enjoy writing code in IDEs, and failing immeasurably, and crying in a corner...   
Well, umm I like `Typescript` `Python` `.NET stuff` and `writing this markdown file at 1AM because i just learned that you can put READMEs in github profile`  
I **HATE** powershell and windowsâ€¦  

## facts OwO
Best IDE is Webstorm, then VS Code, then PyCharm, then Intellij Idea!  
Assembly and C++ are the worst
